# BankMarketingModeling

This README.md will act as technical documentation for the machine learning pipeline implemented on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). A Portuguese banking institution derived the dataset from a direct marketing campaign made via phone calls. This project aims to accurately predict the success of future campaigns based on the attributes listed in the dataset, implementing a high-preforming machine learning model. The generalized ML pipeline is outlined in the diagram below.
