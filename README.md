# Bank Marketing Modeling

This README.md will act as technical documentation for the machine learning pipeline implemented on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). A Portuguese banking institution derived the dataset from a direct marketing campaign made via phone calls. This project aims to accurately predict the success of future campaigns based on the attributes listed in the dataset, implementing a high-preforming machine learning model. The generalized ML pipeline is outlined in the diagram below.

This document will follow the steps outlined in the ML pipeline above, giving exaplanations for technical considerations and decisions made along the way. The following list summarizes each step in the process:
